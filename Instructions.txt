for properly running the program you have to put the train.csv file and test.csv file and ideal.csv file in the same location of the this python program.
if any of those files do not exist, the program shows the proper error and tells about it.
the progrm output is 4 plot that each one represents one train function separately, then it shows the content of the 
answer table(Test_Table) this table has 4 columns the first two columns store the x and y of test points and the third
column stores the minimum y deviation between the test point and corresponding ideal point in selected ideal function(if
the point mapped with any ideal function) and the 4th column stores the name of mapped ideal function for each 
test point if exists.
for the test points which not mapped with any ideal function,the program puts 0 in the coressponding cell.
if a test point mapped with more than one ideal function, the program chooses the ideal function with minimum y deviation
